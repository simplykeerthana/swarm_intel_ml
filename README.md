Metaheuristic (Ricardo)

* BatAlgorithm
* BeesAlgorithm
* CuckooSearch


Swarm (Keerthana)
* ArtificialBeeColonyAlgorithm
* CatSwarmOptimization
* ParticleSwarmOptimization


Stuff to do:

1. Use different parameters for each algorithm to see whether the accuracy changes or not. Check the classification report to check different methods. 
2. a juypter notebook for each of the algorithms. 

Meet on Sunday March 26th, to review results and complete the report.
